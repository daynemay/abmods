Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/abmods

Once upon a time, I wrote a bunch of utilities to streamline my use of the Progress / OpenEdge AppBuilder.

Today (2015-03-14) I exported that code from Google Code into GitHub. I haven't looked at it in ages, don't anticipate using it again, and would likely be embarrassed if I tried to do either. It's here just on the off chance that I want something from it again.
